# Data Science Learning - Repository

Welcome to my Data Science learning repository! This repository contains various notebooks, notes, and resources I've compiled while learning data science concepts, Python libraries, and statistical methods.

## Contents

### Jupyter Notebooks

- **[Python.ipynb](Python.ipynb)** - Core Python programming concepts and fundamentals
- **[NumPy.ipynb](NumPy.ipynb)** - Numerical computing with NumPy arrays and operations
- **[Pandas.ipynb](Pandas.ipynb)** - Data manipulation and analysis using Pandas
- **[Matplotlib_Seaborn_Plotly_Cufflinks.ipynb](Matplotlib_Seaborn_Plotly_Cufflinks.ipynb)** - Data visualization techniques with multiple libraries:
  - Matplotlib for basic plotting
  - Seaborn for statistical visualizations
  - Plotly for interactive plots
  - Cufflinks for Pandas integration with Plotly
- **[Stats_College_1.ipynb](Stats_College_1.ipynb)** - Statistical concepts and college-level statistics

### Documents & Resources

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ShardenduMishra22/Data-Science.git
   cd Data-Science
   ```

2. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn plotly cufflinks jupyter
   ```

3. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
