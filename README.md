# Data Science Learning Repository

Welcome to my Data Science learning repository! This repository contains various notebooks, notes, and resources I've compiled while learning data science concepts, Python libraries, and statistical methods.

## Contents

### Jupyter Notebooks

- **[Python.ipynb](Python.ipynb)** - Core Python programming concepts and fundamentals
- **[NumPy.ipynb](NumPy.ipynb)** - Numerical computing with NumPy arrays and operations
- **[Pandas.ipynb](Pandas.ipynb)** - Data manipulation and analysis using Pandas
- **[Matplotlib_Seaborn_Plotly_Cufflinks.ipynb](Matplotlib_Seaborn_Plotly_Cufflinks.ipynb)** - Data visualization techniques with multiple libraries:
  - Matplotlib for basic plotting
  - Seaborn for statistical visualizations
  - Plotly for interactive plots
  - Cufflinks for Pandas integration with Plotly
- **[Stats_College_1.ipynb](Stats_College_1.ipynb)** - Statistical concepts and college-level statistics

### Documents & Resources

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ShardenduMishra22/Data-Science.git
   cd Data-Science
   ```

2. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn plotly cufflinks jupyter
   ```

3. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
